# Javascript Tutorial Import and Closure


## Recreate procedure

### Instantiate a node project by:
```bash
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file.

From here, you can install external library.

### Install Lodash

Install lodash package:
```bash
npm install lodash
```

After installing the first package, you should see a `node_modules` directory.

This is the place where packages are located.

You can also use:
```bash
npm i lodash
```

To install development dependency, run:
```bash
npm i -D <package-name>
```

`-D` stands for devDpendency
